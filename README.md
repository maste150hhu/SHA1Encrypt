# SHA1Encrypt - SHA1 in Java by using an Encrypt Object

This repository offers a simple implementation of a SHA1-Encrypt, inspired by GeeksforGeeks!

## ! Important Note !
## As it was possible to cause a collision in the SHA1-Encryption in 2017 by spending 110000USD

## SHA1 is no longer a secure encryption! 

## You can still use it for Hashing since the probability for a collision is around 1:2^160 or 1:10^48.
